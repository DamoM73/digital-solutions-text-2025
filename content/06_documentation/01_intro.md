# Documentation Introduction

Documentation is a vital part of both Digital Solutions and the software development in general. For software development, documentation helps you develop a clear roadmap for your application. It clearly maps from the users' needs and wants, through possible designs, to the evaluation of your product. Documentation helps you anticipate many problems before they arise.

The documentation is vital in demonstrating many of skills that are assessed in Digital Solutions. Throughout an assessment, you will analyse the scenario to identify the users' needs and wants, synthesize these needs to develop success criteria, user interfaces, data stores, and controlling code, and evaluate the solution to refine the it and provide recommendations for future improvements. Importantly, the documentation provides evidence of all this problem-solving. This effects your results.
