# Mock-ups üìù

:::{dropdown} Learning Goals
By the end of this section you will:
- understand the purpose of sketches, wireframes and mock-ups in designing UIs
- understand the elements that make up mock-ups
- understand how annotated mock-ups are used to demonstrate useability and visual communication incorporation in design decisions
:::

In UI Design it is most important to demonstrate how the user will interact with your application. **Sketches**, **wireframes**, and **mock-ups** are used at different stages of development to plan and visualise the interface.

- **Sketches**
  - Quick, freehand drawings
  - Used early to explore ideas
  - Focus on layout and basic function
  - Not detailed or to scale
- **Wireframes**
  - Structured, simplified layouts
  - Show placement of UI elements (buttons, menus, images)
  - Often in black and white or grayscale
  - Help define content hierarchy and functionality
- **Mock-ups**
  - High-fidelity visual designs
  - Include colours, fonts, spacing and branding
  - Look like the final product but aren‚Äôt interactive
  - Used for client presentation or UI testing

**Key features of mock-ups**:
- Visual accuracy:
  - Display exact colours, fonts, spacing, icons, images, and branding
  - Represent the final visual style of the UI
- Not interactive:
  - Unlike prototypes, mock-ups do not include clickable elements or animations
  - They show appearance, not behaviour
- Used for feedback:
  - Help clients, stakeholders, and users understand what the final product will look like
  - Allow for early visual testing and feedback before development begins
- Created with design tools:
  - Common tools include Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch, or Canva

**Purpose in UI design**:
- Communicate detailed visual design choices
- Support decision-making about colours, typography, and layout
- Identify visual issues before coding
- Bridge the gap between wireframes and prototypes

**For Digital Solutions**:
- an essential way of demonstrating how the success criteria have informed your design decisions.
- demonstrate your understanding of [useability principles](../03_user_experience/02_usability_principles.md) and [visual communication](../03_user_experience/03_visual_communication.md)
