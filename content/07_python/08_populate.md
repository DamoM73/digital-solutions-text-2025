:::

In this section we will learn how to parse a CSV file into a SQLite database. We will populate the **f1_driver.db** with the data contained in the **F1Drivers_Dataset.csv** file. We will continue to use the MVC architecture, meaning this code will be placed in the **Datastore** class and be called from the **main.py** file.

## F1 Database Structure

Before we populate a database, we would have already designed the data structure and created the tables that form our database. The **f1_drive.db** contains our database which uses the structure below.

![f1_driver.bd ERD](./assets/08/03_erd_f1_drivers.png)

When populating a database, we need to be aware of foreign keys. We cannot write to a table if it contains foreign keys which link to an unpopulated table. Looking at the ERD above and we can observe the populate order should be:

1. **Driver table** - there are no foreign keys.
2. **Season table** - the only foreign key is Champion, which is linked to the populated Driver_ID field.
3. **Raced table** - the two foreign keys link to fields that we have populated.

## Explore the Dataset
Whenever you work with a dataset, it is important to explore it first. You need to understand it, in order to ensure the integrity of the data as you parse it into your database structure.

Click on the **F1Drivers_Dataset.csv** to view it's content. You will see the raw data below.

![f1_csv_raw](./assets/08/01_raw_csv.png)

Although the colour helps, the columns are a bit hard to use, so press **Ctrl/Cmd** + **P** and then type **Convert to table from CSV**. This should present the data below.

![f1_csv-table](./assets/08/02_table_csv.png)

Scrolling through the data we can make some observations about how we will need to process the data:

- CSV files are essentially text files. Programming languages use protocols to add functionality, but they are still text files. Therefore, everything read from the text file will be a string. This means that any data that is not a TEXT type, will need to be converted into the appropriate type for processing.
- **Seasons** and **Championship Years** fields contain lists. These two will be read as a string, and we will need to convert them into lists for processing.
- All the numbers that are written as floats (eg. **Championships**) do not have any decimal value, and are logically integers&mdash;you can't have 0.5 of a championship&mdash; so we will need to convert them into integers.

## Initial Processing

:::{danger}Before your start
You will need to make of copy of the **f1_driver.db** file. Databases do not allow for undos, so we will need a fresh version of **f1_driver.db**.

Select the **f1_driver.db** file and then press **Ctrl/Cmd** + **C** to copy. Then press **Ctrl/Cmd** + **V** to paste it. You should now have a **f1_driver copy.db** file.
:::

A common problem with processing data into databases is not knowing the data that is being parsed. To address this, throughout coding the populate solution we will first extract the data from the CSV and print it to terminal. This way we can see the *actual* data we will write to the database. Once we are confident that the data is correct, we can then send it to the database.

First we will do this for the entire CSV, so we can see what is returned when we read the CSV.

---

### Create datastore.py

In your Unit 3 repo, create a new file called **f1_datastore.py**, then add the following code:

```{code}python
:linenos:
import sqlite3


class Datastore:
    """
    Datastore for the f1 driver database
    """

    def __init__(self, database_file: str, data_file: str):
        """
        initialises the datastore
        """
        self.database_file = database_file
        self.data_file = data_file
        self.conn = sqlite3.connect(self.database_file)
        self.cursor = self.conn.cursor()

        self.populate_database()
```

:::{important} Explanation of Code
:class: dropdown
- lines 3-8 &rarr; create a `Datastore` class which accepts a filenames for the database file and data file.
- line 12 &rarr; stores the database filename.
- line 13 &rarr; stores the data filename.
- line 14 &rarr; connects to the database.
- line 15 &rarr; creates a database cursor for manipulating data.
:::

Now that we have connected to the database, we need to start reading data from the CSV file. To do this we need to import the csv module.

```
:linenos:
:emphasize-lines:2
import sqlite3
import csv
```

We will also modularise all the population code into a separate method. This method needs to be called at the end of the `__init__()` method.

```
:linenos:
:lineno-start: 10
:emphasize-lines:19
    def __init__(self, database_file: str, data_file: str):
        """
        initialises the datastore
        """
        self.database_file = database_file
        self.data_file = data_file
        self.conn = sqlite3.connect(self.database_file)
        self.cursor = self.conn.cursor()

        self.populate_database()
```

Next we will open and read the CSV file, with each row being converted into a dictionary. This will produce an iterable object (something that can be processed using a `for` loop) of dictionaries. We'll then iterate over this object, printing out all the dictionaries.

```
:linenos:
:lineno-start: 21
    def populate_database(self):
        """
        populates the database with data from the csv file
        """
        with open(self.data_file, mode="r", encoding="utf-8") as csvfile:
            csv_reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile)

            # process the CSV data
            for record in csv_reader:
                print(record)
```

:::{important} Explanation of Code
:class: dropdown
- line 21 &rarr; creates the **populate_database** method
- line 25 &rarr; opens the CSV file
  - `mode = "r"` &rarr; opened in reading mode
  - `encoding="utf-8"` &rarr; allows the reading of non-English characters
  - `as csvfile` &rarr; stores the open file in the `csvfile` variable
- line 26 &rarr; creates a Dictreader object that reads each row of the CSV file as a dictionary, where the keys are the column headers from the first row of the file.
- line 29 &rarr; starts a loop that goes through each row in the CSV file, as provided by csv_reader, record is a dictionary representing one row from the CSV.
- line 30 &rarr; prints the current record dictionary
:::

### Create the main.py

In order to test our code, we now need to create a **main.py** file. In this file we need to create an instance of our Datastore object. We use the following code to do this.

```
:linenos:
from f1_datastore import Datastore

db = Datastore("f1_driver.db", "data/F1Drivers_Dataset.csv")
```

### Test Initial Processing

Now we can test the initial processing by running **main.py**

Your terminal should stream a list of dictionaries (868 of the to be exact). This is the data that is being read from the CSV file. Lets have a look at one of these dictionaries. I have formatted the last dictionary to make it easier to read.

```
{
    'Driver': 'Ricardo Zunino', 
    'Nationality': 'Argentina', 
    'Seasons': '[1979, 1980, 1981]', 
    'Championships': '0.0', 
    'Race_Entries': '11.0', 
    'Race_Starts': '10.0', 
    'Pole_Positions': '0.0', 
    'Race_Wins': '0.0', 
    'Podiums': '0.0', 
    'Fastest_Laps': '0.0', 
    'Points': '0.0', 
    'Active': 'False', 
    'Championship Years': '', 
    'Decade': '1980', 
    'Pole_Rate': '0.0', 
    'Start_Rate': '0.9090909090909091', 
    'Win_Rate': '0.0', 
    'Podium_Rate': '0.0', 
    'FastLap_Rate': '0.0', 
    'Points_Per_Entry': '0.0', 
    'Years_Active': '3', 
    'Champion': 'False'
}
```

The first thing we can notice is that there is more data in the dictionary, than can be stored in the database. That's because `Pole_Rate`, `Start_Rate`, `Win_Rate`, `Podium_Rate`, `FastLap_Rate`, `Points_Per_Entry`, `Years_Active`, and `Champion` can all be calculated from the other values. 

The next thing we can notice is that each value is a string, meaning that we need to covert it into the correct data type for the dictionary.

Finally the `Seasons` value is a string representing a list. This will need to be converted and then iterated over. For example, processing Ricardo's seasons will require three entries into the database (one for each year).

## Driver Data

Looking at the [Data Structure ERD](#f1-database-structure), or viewing the **f1_driver.db** file, we can see that the Driver table requires the following fields:
- driver_id
- name
- nationality
- race_entries
- race_starts
- pole_positions
- race_wins
- podiums
- fastest_laps
- points

Here is the pseudocode for the process we will follow:

```
:linenos:
FOR record IN csv_reader
    name = record[Driver]
    nationality = record[Nationality]
    race_entries = record[Race_Entries]
    race_starts = record[Race_Starts]
    pole_positions = record[Pole_Positions]
    race_wins = record[Race_Wins]
    podiums = record[Podiums]
    fastest_laps = record[Fastest_Laps]
    points = record[Points]
    
    INSERT INTO driver table (driver data) 
NEXT record
ENDFOR
```

We will do this in two stages:
1. process the driver data and output them to terminal - this will allow us to check that the data is correct.
2. change the output to insert the values in the database.

### Process Driver Data

Return to our **f1_datastore.py** file and replace the `print` statement on **line 30** with the code below:

```
:linenos:
:lineno-start: 28
:emphasize-lines: 30-52
            # process the CSV data
            for record in csv_reader:
                # process driver values
                name = record["Driver"]
                nationality = record["Nationality"]
                race_entries = int(float(record["Race_Entries"]))
                race_starts = int(float(record["Race_Starts"]))
                pole_positions = int(float(record["Pole_Positions"]))
                race_wins = int(float(record["Race_Wins"]))
                podiums = int(float(record["Podiums"]))
                fastest_laps = int(float(record["Fastest_Laps"]))
                points = float(record["Points"])

                # view the driver data
                print(
                    name,
                    nationality,
                    race_entries,
                    race_starts,
                    pole_positions,
                    race_wins,
                    podiums,
                    fastest_laps,
                    points,
                )
```

:::{important} Explanation of Code

- lines 42 - 52 &rarr; displays the processed driver data to the terminal.
:::

Save **f1_datastore.py**.

### Test Driver Data

Go back and run **main.py** to test our code.

Your terminal should display all the data that is read from the CSV file and processed ready to write to the database. The last five lines should look like this:

```{code}bash
:linenos:
Emilio Zapico Spain 1 0 0 0 0 0 0.0
Zhou Guanyu China 23 23 0 0 0 2 6.0
Ricardo Zonta Brazil 37 36 0 0 0 0 3.0
Renzo Zorzi Italy 7 7 0 0 0 0 1.0
Ricardo Zunino Argentina 11 10 0 0 0 0 0.0
```

This step is really important, as it shows us the *actual* data we will send to the database. Check it to make sure there isn't a mistake.

### Write Driver Data to Database

Now we need to send the driver data to the database rather than the terminal.

Back in **f1_datastore.py** we need to create a method that writes the data to the driver table. Add the following code under the `__init__()`:

```
:linenos:
:lineno-start: 54
    def add_driver(
        self,
        name: str,
        nationality: str,
        race_entries: int,
        race_starts: int,
        pole_positions: int,
        race_wins: int,
        podiums: int,
        fastest_laps: int,
        points: float,
    ):
        """
        adds a driver to the database
        """
        self.cursor.execute(
            """
            INSERT INTO Driver (name, nationality, race_entries, race_starts, pole_positions, race_wins, podiums, fastest_laps, points)
            VALUES (:name, :nationality, :race_entries, :race_starts, :pole_positions, :race_wins, :podiums, :fastest_laps, :points)
            """,
            {
                "name": name,
                "nationality": nationality,
                "race_entries": race_entries,
                "race_starts": race_starts,
                "pole_positions": pole_positions,
                "race_wins": race_wins,
                "podiums": podiums,
                "fastest_laps": fastest_laps,
                "points": points,
            },
        )
```

:::{important} Explanation of Code
:class: dropdown
- lines 54 - 65 &rarr; define the method and list all the data that needs to be provided to the method.
- lines 69 - 85 &rarr; are the parameterised SQL statement that will be run on the database.
  - lines 70 - 73 &rarr; are the SQL statement template without the data.
  - lines 74 - 84 &rarr; is a dictionary that contains the data to be plugged into the command template.
:::

:::{hint} Parameterized SQL statements
:class: dropdown
A way of safely and efficiently inserting values into SQL queries without building the query as a string. Instead of directly inserting values into a query (which can lead to errors or security issues), placeholders are used, and values are provided separately.

Parameterized SQL statements are used to:
- Prevent SQL Injection by separating code from data.
- Improve performance by allowing databases to cache execution plans.
- Reduce errors by helping to avoid syntax issues with strings, numbers, dates.
:::

Now we need to call the `add_driver` method from the `populate_database` method. Go up to the `populate_database` method and change the `print` in line 42, to a `add_driver` call.

```
:linenos:
:lineno-start: 41
:emphasize-lines: 42
                # view the driver data
                self.add_driver(
                    name,
                    nationality,
                    race_entries,
                    race_starts,
                    pole_positions,
                    race_wins,
                    podiums,
                    fastest_laps,
                    points,
                )
```

Finally we need to commit the changes we made to the database. We will do this in the `__init__`. Go to the `__init__` method and add the highlighted code to the bottom.

```
:linenos:
:lineno-start: 10
:emphasize-lines: 20
    def __init__(self, database_file: str, data_file: str):
        """
        initialises the datastore
        """
        self.database_file = database_file
        self.data_file = data_file
        self.conn = sqlite3.connect(self.database_file)
        self.cursor = self.conn.cursor()

        self.populate_database()
        self.conn.commit()
```

Save **f1_datastore.py**.

### Test Writing Driver Data

Go back to **main.py** and run it to test our code.

To see if it worked we need to look into the data stored in the driver table. To do this, in the files panel, **right-click** on **f1_driver.db** and select Open Database.

![open database](./assets/08/04_open_database.png)

Then look to the bottom of the file panel then click:
1. The dropdown arrow beside SQLITE EXPLORER
2. The dropdown arrow beside f1_driver.db
3. The dropdown arrow beside Driver
4. The solid arrow to the right of Driver

![view database](./assets/08/05_view_database.png)

A panel should open to the right of your code showing the content of the Driver table.

:::{danger} Refresh f1_driver.db
If your code passes your test, we need to return the database file back to blank. To do this:
1. select the **f1_driver.db** file and delete it.
2. rename the **f1_driver copy.db** file to **f1_driver.db**
3. then, with **f1_driver.db** still selected, press **Ctrl/Cmd** + **C** to copy. 
4. press **Ctrl/Cmd** + **V** to paste it.
5. you should once again have a **f1_driver copy.db** file and a **f1_driver.db** file
:::

## Seasons Data

We will take the data for Seasons table from the **Championship Years** field. In the data this field contains strings that represent a list of integers, so there will need to be more converting of data types.

If we look at the data in the **Championship Years** column we see that:

- it is most frequently blank &rarr; we need to check that the field is not blank before writing to the database
- when there is data, it is a list &rarr; when there is data, we will need write to the database for each year in the field.

The pseudocode for the processing the seasons data is as follows:

```
:linenos:
:emphasize-lines: 5
FOR record IN csv_reader
    IF record[Championship Years] IS NOT NULL THEN
        years = CONVERT record[Championship Years] INTO LIST
        FOR year IN years
            INSERT INTO seasons table (year, driver_id)
        NEXT year
        END FOR
    END IF
NEXT record
END FOR
```

Notice the **driver_id** in line 5, this presents us with a problem. We need to use the **driver_id** for the current driver we just wrote to the **driver** table. Fortunately **sqlite3** provides a solution.

### Get driver_id

We will use a method where the cursor provides the row_id for the last row it wrote to the database. We can simply get **add_driver** to return that value and then store it in a variable for later use.

Go to the very end of our `add_driver` method and add the highlighted line.

```
:linenos:
:lineno-start: 75
:emphasize-lines: 88
                    {
                "name": name,
                "nationality": nationality,
                "race_entries": race_entries,
                "race_starts": race_starts,
                "pole_positions": pole_positions,
                "race_wins": race_wins,
                "podiums": podiums,
                "fastest_laps": fastest_laps,
                "points": points,
            },
        )

        return self.cursor.lastrowid 
```

We are now returning the **driver_id** now we need to store it somewhere. Go to where we call `add_driver` in the `populate_database` method. Then assign the return value to a variable:

```{code}python
:linenos:
:lineno-start: 42
:emphasize-lines: 43
                # view the driver data
                driver_id = self.add_driver(
                    name,
                    nationality,
                    race_entries,
                    race_starts,
                    pole_positions,
                    race_wins,
                    podiums,
                    fastest_laps,
                    points,
                )
```

### Process Seasons Data

Now we need extract the data for the Seasons table. Just like the driver data, we will first display this data to the terminal so we can check it.

Go to the bottom of the `populate_database` method. Make sure that our indents place this code inside the `for record in csv_reader` loop. Add the highlighted code below:

```{code}python
:linenos:
:lineno-start: 42
:emphasize-lines: 55-60
                # view the driver data
                driver_id = self.add_driver(
                    name,
                    nationality,
                    race_entries,
                    race_starts,
                    pole_positions,
                    race_wins,
                    podiums,
                    fastest_laps,
                    points,
                )

                # process only the championship years
                if record["Championship Years"]:
                    years = ast.literal_eval(record["Championship Years"])

                    for year in years:
                        print(year, driver_id)
```

1. select the **f1_driver.db** file and delete it.
2. rename the **f1_driver copy.db** file to **f1_driver.db**
3. then, with **f1_driver.db** still selected, press **Ctrl/Cmd** + **C** to copy. 
4. press **Ctrl/Cmd** + **V** to paste it.
5. you should once again have a **f1_driver copy.db** file and a **f1_driver.db** file

### Write Seasons Data to Database

Our data is correct, so we can write it to the Seasons table.

Return to **f1_datastore.py** and then below the `add_driver` method create the `add_season` method.


```{code}python
:linenos:
:lineno-start: 98
    def add_season(self, year: int, champion: int):
        """
        adds a season to the database
        """
        self.cursor.execute(
            """
            INSERT INTO Seasons
            VALUES (:year, :champion)
            """,
            {
                "year": year, 
                "champion": champion
            },
        )
```

:::{important} Explanation of Code
:class: dropdown
If you have a keen eye you may have noticed that line 7 looks different to our last INSERT statement &ndash; it doesn't have any field names. Why?

If you look at the [Data Structure ERD] you will notice that the primary key (year) is a value that we are taking from the CSV file, therefore it is not auto-increment.

In SQL, when you INSERT all the values into a table, you don't have to list the field names, they just get written in order. So the first VALUE item get written to the first field of the table, the second VALUE to the second field, and so-on.
:::

Then go up to the `populate_database` method and replace the print statement on line 61 with a call to the `add_season` method:

```{code}python
:linenos:
:lineno-start:56
:emphasize-lines:61
                # process only the championship years
                if record["Championship Years"]:
                    years = ast.literal_eval(record["Championship Years"])

                    for year in years:
                        self.add_season(year, driver_id)
```

Save **f1_datastore.py**

### Test Writing Seasons Data

Run **main.py** then check that the data is written correctly into the database.

## Raced Data

Onto our final table &ndash; Raced. 

We will use the data from the **Seasons** column of the CSV. Looking at the data, it is a list and very similar to the **Championship Years** data. In fact it is a little simpler since there are no blank fields.

The pseudocode for processing this data is:

```
:linenos:
:emphasize-lines: 4
FOR record IN csv_reader
    seasons = CONVERT record[Seasons] INTO LIST
    FOR season IN seasons
        INSERT INTO raced table (driver_id, season)
    NEXT season
    END FOR
NEXT record
END FOR
```

Be careful with line 4, in this table **driver_id** comes first

### Processing Raced Data

Fortunately, we already have the driver_id data, so we only need to extract the Raced data from the Season column of the CSV. 

At the bottom of the `populate_database` method in **f1_datastore.py** add the following code:

```{code}python
:linenos:
:lineno-start:56
:emphasize-lines: 63,64,65,66
                # process driver seasons
                seasons = ast.literal_eval(record["Seasons"])
                for season in seasons:
                    print(driver_id, season)
```

This code is virtually the same as processing Championship Years.

Save **f1_datastore.py**

### Testing Raced Data

Run **main.py** and check the data in the terminal against the data in the CSV and database.

:::{danger} Refresh f1_driver.db

If your code passes your test, we need to return the database file back to blank. To do this:
1. select the **f1_driver.db** file and delete it.
2. rename the **f1_driver copy.db** file to **f1_driver.db**
3. then, with **f1_driver.db** still selected, press **Ctrl/Cmd** + **C** to copy. 
4. press **Ctrl/Cmd** + **V** to paste it.
5. you should once again have a **f1_driver copy.db** file and a **f1_driver.db** file
:::

### Writing Raced Data

In **f1_datastore.py** create the `add_raced` method by add the code below:

```{code}python
:linenos:
:lineno-start: 118
    def add_raced(self, driver_id: int, year: int):
        self.cursor.execute(
            """
            INSERT INTO Raced
            VALUES (:driver_id, :year)
            """,
            {
                "driver_id": driver_id, 
                "year": year
            },
        )
```

Then we need to replace the `print` in the `populate_database` method with a call to the `add_raced` method.

```{code}python
:linenos:
:lineno-start: 63
:emphasize-lines: 66
                # process driver seasons
                seasons = ast.literal_eval(record["Seasons"])
                for season in seasons:
                    self.add_raced(driver_id, season)
```

Save **f1_datastore.py**.

### Test Writing Raced Data

Time to run our final test. Run **main.py** and then check that the data is correctly written to the database.

## Exercise

Now that we have finished our F1 driver database, it's time to apply this knowledge to a new dataset.

In your Unit 3 repo you will have the **netflix_titles.csv** and **netflix_shows.db** files. Below is the data structure ERD.

![netflix ERD](./assets/08/06_erd_netflix.png)

This is a much larger dataset and more complicated database. Never-the-less, the concepts and processes are the same as the F1 Drivers database. 

Make sure that you follow the same process:

1. View the dataset in CSV
2. Connect and print CSV to terminal
3. Identify the order of tables to populate (hint: check the numbers on the ERD)
4. For each table:
   - process the data to terminal and check
   - write data to table and check
