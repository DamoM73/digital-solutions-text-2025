# Data Transmission Introduction

Digital solutions are increasingly required to exchange data securely and efficiently. In this section we will investigate elements of cybersecurity by exploring the conditions, environment and methods that enable data flow between different digital systems.

We will analyse data privacy and data integrity risks associated with transferring data between applications. We will also evaluate the personal, social and economic impacts associated with the use and availability of both public and private data.

This focus is broken into four parts:

- **Privacy:** collecting and using personal data ethically
- **Networks:** how data is transfer between computers
- **Data security:** methods of ensuring the safe storage and transfer of data
- **Data Threats:** dangers that data need to be protected against
