If you are a member of a modern society, your personal data has been collected. Sometimes it is collected by governments, but mostly it is collected by corporations. It is that extensive that an entire industry has developed collate and on-sell personal data ([data brokers](https://www.security.org/data-removal/data-broker/)) and sparking a counter industry aimed at removing personal data from these data brokers ([personal data removal services](https://au.pcmag.com/security/110363/personal-data-removal-services-how-they-work-and-why-you-need-one)).

But many of our day-to-day services run on this data, so why is it a concern? Check the video below for an explanation.

:::{tip} Video Summary
:class: dropdown
This video explains the critical importance of data privacy and ethics in today's digital world, where personal information is widely collected and used.

Key issues and concerns highlighted include:

1. **Data Collection and Consent:**
   - **Issue:** Organizations often collect user data without users fully understanding what's being collected or how it will be used.
   - **Concern &ndash; Informed Consent:** Users frequently agree to terms without full comprehension, leading to potential unauthorized use of their information.
   - **Concern &ndash; Transparency:** Lack of transparency from companies about their data practices can make users feel their privacy is compromised.
2. **Data Storage and Security:**
   - **Issue:** Large data repositories are attractive targets for cybercriminals.
   - **Concern &ndash; Data Breaches:** Inadequate security measures can expose personal information, leading to risks like identity theft.
3. **Data Sharing and Third-Party Access:**
   - **Issue:** Sharing data with third-party vendors increases the risk of unauthorized access.
   - **Concern &ndash; Lack of User Control:** Once data is shared, users have little control over its subsequent use, potentially leading to unwanted targeting.
4. **Data Profiling and Surveillance:**
   - **Issue:** Organizations use data profiling to make inferences about behaviour, which can impact decisions like credit scores or job prospects.
   - **Concern &ndash; Privacy Intrusion:** This practice can feel invasive as individual behaviours are tracked to build detailed profiles.

The video then emphasizes Ethical Considerations in Data Use, stressing the need for responsible data handling and prioritizing individual rights. A key ethical practice is:

5. **Transparency and Honesty:** Organizations should clearly communicate how data is collected, used, and shared.
    - **Importance &ndash; Building Trust:** Transparent data practices are crucial for building trust with users, reassuring them that their information is handled responsibly.

So you can see that Data privacy is fundamental because it safeguards individuals from harms associated with the exposure or misuse of their personal information. Personal data can reveal sensitive details about a person’s identity, habits, health, finances, and more. Unauthorized access or disclosure can lead to identity theft, financial loss, reputational damage, and emotional distress. 

In this section we will explore what we need to take into consideration when handling data in Australia.

## Information as a Commodity

Information as a commodity refers to the idea that information—like physical goods—can be bought, sold, and traded for economic value. In the digital age, information and data have become valuable resources, much like oil or gold, because they can be used to drive business decisions, predict consumer behaviour, and tailor products and services.

**Characteristics of Information as a Commodity**

- **Intangibility:** Unlike physical goods, information is intangible; it can be shared, copied, and used by many people simultaneously without being depleted.
- **Tradability:** Information can be packaged, sold, or licensed in various forms, such as databases, reports, software, or digital media.
- **Value Creation:** The value of information comes from its ability to inform decisions, control processes, and create competitive advantages in markets.
- **Market Dynamics:** Information exhibits economic properties such as supply, demand, cost, price, and markets. It can be traded as a private good (sold for profit) or provided as a public good (freely shared).
- **Low Marginal Cost:** Once created, information can be reproduced and distributed at almost zero cost, unlike traditional goods where each additional unit has a production cost.

**Examples**

- Market research reports, customer databases, software, e-books, and streaming media are all examples of information commodities.
- Data brokers aggregate and sell personal data, turning individual digital footprints into tradable assets.

This value of data can lead to exploitation which raises ethical and legal concern around it's collection. 

## Handling Personal Data

The collecting of personal data raises a range of ethical concerns. 

### Privacy Violations

Collecting data without proper authorization or consent can infringe on individuals’ privacy, exposing sensitive personal information and breaching confidentiality.

Even anonymized data can sometimes be re-identified, leading to unintended privacy breaches.

###  Informed Consent

Ethical data collection requires clear, informed consent from individuals, ensuring they understand what data is being collected, how it will be used, and with whom it may be shared.

Many consent processes are inadequate, with users often agreeing to terms they do not fully understand.

### Data Security

Organizations have an ethical obligation to protect collected data from unauthorized access, breaches, or leaks, which could result in identity theft, financial harm, or reputational damage.

High-profile breaches highlight the risks and the importance of robust security measures.

### Bias and Discrimination

Data collection and analysis can perpetuate or amplify biases, especially if datasets are unrepresentative or algorithms are not carefully managed, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes.

Technologies like facial recognition have faced criticism for racial bias and inaccuracies.

### Transparency and Accountability

Ethical data collection demands transparency about what data is collected, why, and how it will be used, enabling individuals to make informed choices.

Lack of transparency erodes trust and can lead to misuse or abuse of data.

### Manipulative and Exploitative Practices

Data can be used unethically for manipulative marketing, psychological profiling, or social manipulation, undermining individual autonomy and democratic processes.

### Data Ownership and Control

There are ongoing ethical debates about who owns personal data and who has the right to control its use, especially as data becomes a valuable asset.

### Data Minimization and Purpose Limitation

Ethically, organizations should collect only the data necessary for a specific purpose and not retain it longer than needed, balancing commercial interests with individual rights.

### Fairness in Use and Retention

The use of data for purposes beyond the original intent without explicit consent is unethical, even if the organization believes it is beneficial.

### Legal and Regulatory Compliance

Navigating and adhering to diverse and evolving data protection laws is both an ethical and legal requirement, ensuring respect for individuals’ rights across jurisdictions.

## Australian Privacy Principles

The [Australian Privacy Principles (APPs)](https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/australian-privacy-principles/australian-privacy-principles-quick-reference) are a set of 13 key rules under the Privacy Act 1988 that govern how Australian organizations and government agencies handle personal information.
