## ORDER BY Clause

The SQL `ORDER BY` keyword is used to sort the result set of a query by one or more columns, either in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.

:::{tip} Summary
:class: dropdown
 **Sorting in Ascending and Descending Order:** 
 - The `ORDER BY` keyword is used to sort the results of a query. 
 - By default, it sorts the data in ascending order (ASC). 
 - To sort in descending order, you must use the `DESC` keyword. 

 **Sorting Different Data Types:** 
 - **Numerical Data:** When applied to numerical columns like "Price," the clause sorts the values from smallest to largest (ascending) or largest to smallest (descending). 
 - **Text Data:** For text-based columns such as "ProductName," `ORDER BY` will sort the data alphabetically. 

 **Sorting by Multiple Columns:** 
 - You can sort by more than one column to create a more refined, hierarchical sorting of your data. 
 - The data will be sorted based on the first column specified, and then the second column will be used to sort any rows that have the same value in the first column. 

 **Mixing Sort Orders:** 
 -  It is possible to sort one column in ascending order and another in descending order within the same query. To do this, you specify `ASC` or `DESC` after each column name in the `ORDER BY` clause.
