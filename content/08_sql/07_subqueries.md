# Subqueries

:::{dropdown} Learning Goals
By the end of this section you will:
- understand that query results can be used as the basis for further queries.
- know how to create subqueries to interrogate data across multiple tables.
:::

All SQL queries return a result in the form of a table, and this result table can be used as the basis for another queryâ€”this is called a subquery. Subqueries allow you to build more complex logic by using the output of one query as input for another.

## The `IN` Operator

The SQL `IN` operator is used to check if a value matches any value in a list or the result of a subquery. Go to the [W3schools Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_in.asp) on the `IN` Operator and complete their exercises.

:::{hint} Writing Subqueries
1. Identify the final result you want:
   - what fields do you want to display indicates the table
   - this becomes the **outer query**
2. Determine what data or filtering is needed to get to that result:
   - the field will appear in the **outer query** `WHERE` clause is your filter
   - the **inner query** needs to return a table consisting of this field
3. The **inner query** provides values for the **outer query**
4. Write the **inner query** first to ensure it returns the correct data
5. Place the **inner query** in parentheses and then write it into the `WHERE` clause of the **outer query**.
   - Make sure the data type and structure of the **inner query** matches what the **outer query** expects
6. Test both queries separately if needed, then combine and run the full subquery structure
:::

Note that subqueries can be endlessly nested.
