We will consider two aspects of Visual Communication:

- Visual Communication Principles
- Visual Communication Elements

You use elements of visual communication to achieve the principles of visual communication.  An analogy, if the **principle** is the cake you want to make, then the **elements** are the ingredients you use to make it.

The activity for this section will involve analysing a website and identifying where visual communication has been used.

The website we will analyse is the [Official Lego website](https://www.lego.com/en-au)
:::

## Visual Communication Principles

The principles of visual communication are the effects you wish to express with your design. They address the overall feel of your design and communicate a message to the user which effects the UI and UX. In other words the principles of visual communication are the **what** that you want to achieve.  

To remember the Visual Communication Principles use the mnemonic: **All Big Cats Have Really Hairy Paws**  

### Alignment

The arrangement of elements along a common axis or edge to create a sense of order, organization, and unity in a design. Alignment can be used to provide unity and proximity to the different elements used in the design. Good alignment aids readability and shows connections between different elements. Objects that are perfectly aligned provide a cleaner aesthetic and more professional appearance which inspires trust and confidence.

**Alignment Examples**

| Type | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Left Align Text | Aligning the text to the left creates a clean and organized appearance. |
| Centre Align Headings | Draws attention and create a focal point. |
| Grid Layouts | Using a grid system ensures consistent alignment of text and images. |
| Bullet Points | Use consistent bullet points or numbering for lists to align items neatly. |
| Align Icons | Aligning icons and buttons helps improves learnability. |

### Balance

The distribution of visual elements within a design to create a sense of stability and equilibrium.

Balance occurs when the combination of elements on one side of a design appears equal to the other side. The weight of the design on each side can be influenced by use of colour, space and shape. For example, adding a dark colour to a small empty space on one side can balance a large area of black type on a white background.

![balance](./assets/03/balance.png)<p>&nbsp;</p>

**Balance Examples**

| Type | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Symmetrical Balance | Identical or similar elements on both sides of a central axis. |
| Asymmetrical Balance | Balancing dissimilar elements by adjusting their size, colour, or position. |
| Radial Balance | Arranging elements radiating outward from a central point. |
| Colour Balance |  Distributing colours evenly across a design. |
| Text and Image Balance | Harmonizing the placement of text and images. |
| Whitespace | Use strategically to create balance by separating content. |
| Visual Weight | Heavier, dominant elements counterbalance lighter, less prominent ones. |

:::

### Contrast

The juxtaposition of elements with differences in characteristics to create visual interest and emphasize distinctions.

Contrast is used to emphasise an element of the design by using a markedly different colour, size or other characteristic. Contrast is also an important factor for readability of text. It is important that there is high contrast between the colour used for typeface and its background colour.

![contrast](./assets/03/contrast.png)<p>&nbsp;</p>

**Contrast Examples**

| Type | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Colour Contrast | Using colour schemes that emphasise contrast or complimentary colours. |
| Font Contrast | Combine fonts with different characteristics. |
| Scale Contrast | Vary the scale of elements. |
| Texture Contrast | Utilize different textures in your design. |
| Shape Contrast | Employ different shapes within your design. |
| Spacing Contrast | Adjust the spacing between elements. |
| Directional Contrast | Arrange elements in contrasting directions. |

### Harmony

The intentional use of design elements and principles to create a balanced, cohesive, and aesthetically pleasing composition.

Harmony is the pleasing effect of combining similar elements such as using similar colours, typeface and shapes throughout the design.

![harmony](./assets/03/harmony.png)<p>&nbsp;</p>

**Harmony Examples**

| Type | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Colour Harmony | Use a colour palette with complementary or analogous colours. |

:::

### Repetition

Involves the consistent use of visual elements, such as colours, fonts, or shapes, to create a cohesive and recognizable design.

Repetition of the same element throughout the design brings consistency, unity and cohesion. For example, repetition of the same icon or button shape can reduce cognitive load and improve learnability for the user. However, too much repetition can become monotonous. Small variations in line, tone or colour to a repeated element can restore interest in the design and helps to retain user attention.

![repetition](./assets/03/repetition.png)<p>&nbsp;</p>

**Repetition Examples**

| Type | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Consistent Fonts | Use the same heading font, subheadings font, and body text font. |
| Colour Palette | Use a predefined colour palette for all elements. |
| Logo Placement |  Place your logo in the same position on all materials. |
| Graphic Elements | Use the same icons, buttons, or graphical elements consistently. |
| Recurring Shapes | Reuse specific shapes or forms consistently. |
| Consistent Spacing | Maintain uniform spacing between text and objects. |
| Standardized Iconography | Use a set of standardized icons or symbols to represent concepts. |

:::

### Hierarchy

The organization and prioritization of elements in a design to guide attention and convey the importance of information.

Hierarchy improves readability of the interface by emphasising more important elements with placement or size. Larger elements or those positioned towards the top of the design are considered more important.

![hierarchy](./assets/03/heirarchy.png)<p>&nbsp;</p>

**Hierarchy Examples**

| Type | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Typography | Use different fonts, sizes, and styles for headings and subheadings. |

:::

### Proximity

Elements placed close together are perceived as related or part of the same group, promoting organization and visual clarity.

Proximity is the positioning of elements near other elements. Proximity is an important factor in useability because it is easier to interact with a digital solution if similar functions are in close proximity to each other, such as the navigation links in a webpage.

![proximity](./assets/03/proximity.png)<p>&nbsp;</p>

**Proximity Examples**

| Type | Details |

## Visual Communication Elements

The **elements** of visual communication are the building block of UI design. By manipulating visual communication elements to implement the principles of visual communication you achieve the desired effect on the UI and, subsequently the UX. In other words, the elements of visual communication are the **how** of what you want top achieve.

To remember the Visual Communication Elements use the mnemonic: **Curious Furry Lions Proudly Sit Sleeping Till Tuesday**

### Colour

Used to convey emotions, establish branding, guide user attention, and enhance usability.

Colour can provide contrast or emphasis, unify a design, fill a shape or space and imply emotion. A colour scheme can be inspired by a logo or photograph. Colour theory defines rules that can be used to select aesthetically pleasing colour combinations.
