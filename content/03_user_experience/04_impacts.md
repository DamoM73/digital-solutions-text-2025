# Impacts üìù

:::{dropdown} Learning Goals
By the end of this section you will:
- understand and be able to assess a digital solution's personal impacts
- understand and be able to assess a digital solution's social impacts
- understand and be able to assess a digital solution's economic impacts
:::

In considering the user experience, you also need to consider the types of impacts the digital solution will have directly on the user and the wider community. Impacts can be both positive and negative, and considerations should be given to promoting the positive impacts and minimising the negative impacts.

We will consider three categories of impact:

- personal impact
- social impact
- economic impact

## Personal Impacts üìù

When evaluating a digital solution, several personal impacts should be considered to ensure the solution enhances individual well-being and does not introduce unintended negative consequences. The table below provides a summary.

| Impact Area | What to Consider |
| :-- | :-- |
| Personal Well-being and Lifestyle | Physical/mental health, stress, digital fatigue |
| Skills, Access, and Usability | Digital literacy, accessibility, user experience |
| Security, Privacy, and Safety | Data protection, cyber risks, confidentiality |
| Social and Ethical Considerations | Social connections, ethics, legal compliance |
| Economic and Practical Factors | Costs, sustainability, practicality |

### Personal Well-being and Lifestyle

- **Health and Well-being:** Consider how the digital solution affects physical and mental health. This includes potential benefits such as improved access to information or services, as well as risks like increased screen time, stress, or exposure to harmful content.
- **Work-life Balance:** Evaluate whether the solution supports a healthy balance between work, study, and personal life, or if it could contribute to overwork or digital fatigue.
- **Subjective Well-being:** Assess the impact on personal happiness, satisfaction, and sense of purpose. Digital solutions can both enhance and diminish subjective well-being depending on their design and use.

### Skills, Access, and Usability

- **Digital Literacy and Skills:** Determine if the individual has the necessary skills to use the solution effectively. Solutions should be accessible to users with varying levels of digital literacy.
- **Usability and User Experience:** Consider how intuitive and user-friendly the solution is. Poor usability can cause frustration and reduce adoption.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure the solution is usable by people with disabilities or those with limited access to technology.

### Security, Privacy, and Safety

- **Personal Security:** Evaluate risks related to data breaches, cyberbullying, identity theft, and other security threats.
- **Privacy:** Assess how personal data is collected, stored, and shared. The solution should comply with privacy laws and respect user confidentiality.

### Social and Ethical Considerations

- **Social Connections:** Consider whether the solution fosters positive social interactions or contributes to isolation and loneliness.
- **Ethical and Legal Compliance:** Ensure the solution aligns with ethical standards and legal requirements, such as avoiding defamation and ensuring inclusivity.

### Economic and Practical Factors

- **Cost and Economic Impact:** Consider personal financial implications, such as purchase costs, subscription fees, or potential savings from increased efficiency.
- **Practicality and Sustainability:** Evaluate if the solution is sustainable for long-term personal use, including maintenance and ongoing support requirements.
