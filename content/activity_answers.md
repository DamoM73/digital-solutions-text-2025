:::

:::{seealso} Social Impacts Activities Solutions
:class: dropdown
**Activity 1: Facial Recognition in Public Spaces**

Equity & Inclusion:

- Studies show facial recognition is significantly less accurate for people with darker skin tones, women, and young people. This can lead to disproportionate targeting, mistaken identity, and harassment, particularly affecting minority and vulnerable groups.
- People from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds may be overrepresented in databases used for surveillance, reinforcing systemic bias.

Well-being & Safety:

- Although promoted as a safety tool, the system may create anxiety and discomfort. Citizens may feel they are constantly monitored, even when not doing anything wrong.
- It can erode public trust in government institutions and law enforcement, especially among communities with a history of being unfairly policed.

Unintended Societal Effects:

- Normalisation of surveillance may discourage protest and free expression.
- Increased social division as people perceive they are being unfairly watched, especially if surveillance is heavier in lower-income or high-diversity areas.
- Sets a precedent for expanding surveillance technologies without strong public oversight.

Recommendations:

- Implement strict policies defining when and where facial recognition can be used.
- Require transparency about how data is stored, who has access, and for how long.
- Mandate third-party bias audits and ban use in schools or areas not proven to benefit from it.
- Provide clear opt-out mechanisms or alternatives for those who do not consent to be scanned.

---

**Activity 2: AI Hiring Tool**

Economic Participation:

- Automating hiring processes can save time and reduce some biases, but often also reduces job opportunities for people with non-traditional experience or resumes (e.g. career changers, refugees, older adults).
- If the AI prefers characteristics based on previous successful hires (e.g. attending elite schools), it reinforces existing barriers to economic mobility.

Equity & Inclusion:

- Marginalised groups (e.g. women, First Nations people, people with disabilities) may be excluded due to algorithmic bias in resume screening.
- AI trained on biased historical hiring data may unintentionally penalise applicants based on name, gender, or cultural background.
- Neurodivergent applicants or those with non-linear career paths may be filtered out unfairly.

Social Justice:

- AI hiring lacks transparency; candidates don’t know how decisions are made, and there may be no way to appeal or request human review.
- Raises legal and ethical concerns under anti-discrimination laws, especially if fairness was not considered in the AI's design.

Recommendations:

- Require human review at critical stages to catch unfair rejections.
- Use diverse training data and conduct regular audits to identify discriminatory outcomes.
- Clearly inform applicants how AI is used and provide meaningful opt-out or appeal options.
- Engage legal and ethical experts when designing or purchasing AI systems.

---

**Activity 3: School Communication App**

Community & Culture:

- The app strengthens parent–teacher communication for tech-savvy families, increasing engagement and transparency.
- However, it weakens relationships with families who lack devices, don’t speak English well, or feel intimidated by digital tools. These families may feel excluded from the school community.

Equity & Inclusion:

- Digital divide is a major issue: low-income households may not have smartphones or internet. Remote or Indigenous communities may have limited connectivity.
- Migrant parents or carers with low literacy may struggle with apps in English.
- Children in these homes miss updates, permission notes, and homework alerts, increasing inequality.

Education Access and Fairness:

- Homework reminders, timetable updates, or absence notifications may never reach some families, leading to lower attendance, missed assignments, and disengagement.
- Some students may be embarrassed that their families don’t use the app, affecting confidence and sense of belonging.

Recommendations:

- Provide printed newsletters and SMS updates for families without app access.
- Translate communications into relevant community languages.
- Survey families to identify barriers to access and target support.
- Offer school workshops on digital literacy for parents.
- Design the app to function on low-bandwidth connections and older devices.

- AI systems increase output speed and reduce waste through precise quality control.
- Operational costs decrease due to fewer errors and downtime.
- Global competitiveness improves, attracting foreign investment and increasing exports.

Employment & Workforce:

- Low-skilled jobs (e.g. manual inspection, warehouse roles) are displaced.
- High demand for data analysts, AI engineers, and robotics technicians.
- Requires strong national focus on reskilling and vocational education reform to prevent unemployment.

Resilience & Innovation:

- Automated systems adapt quickly to changes in demand or disruptions in supply chains.
- AI encourages innovation in product design and customisation.
- Stronger ability to compete with advanced economies in the global tech-driven market.

Public Revenue & Policy:

- Decline in payroll tax from lost jobs may impact revenue.
- Potential for new tax policies targeting automation or AI-driven productivity.
- Public investment needed in training subsidies, social safety nets, and digital infrastructure.
