| ------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | **Safety**                        | Move the 'Delete' button away from 'Save' and add a confirmation dialog before deletion.                             |
| 2       | **Accessibility**                 | Use a high-contrast colour scheme (e.g. black text on white background) and test using the Colour Contrast Analyser. |
| 3       | **Learnability**                  | Add an onboarding tutorial, tooltips, or a help screen with brief explanations.                                      |
| 4       | **Efficiency / Utility**          | Add a dropdown list or autocomplete for common subjects to save time and reduce errors.                              |
| 5       | **Effectiveness / Safety**        | Prevent crashes by making due date optional or showing a clear error message before saving.                          |
| 6       | **Effectiveness / Reliability**   | Fix the reminder system to ensure it works consistently, even after the app is closed.                               |
| 7       | **Learnability / Accessibility**  | Add text labels or tooltips to icons and use familiar symbols (e.g. trash can for delete).                           |
| 8       | **Safety**                        | Include a confirmation step before deleting tasks to avoid accidental loss.                                          |
| 9       | **Accessibility / Effectiveness** | Increase button size and spacing for easier touch use, especially on mobile.                                         |
| 10      | **Safety / Utility**              | Instead of deleting completed tasks, move them to a “Completed” tab with an option to restore.                       |
